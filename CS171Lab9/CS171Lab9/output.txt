5. Other Features


        Of course, the set of capabilities that are described here wouldn't make for

        would certainly have additional features, suchwould certainly have 
        features, suchfeatures, such as a mechanism for creating subsections and 
        etc.  There would also have to be a system for supporting floating blocks of 
        such as figures and tablessuch as figures and tables that might need to 
        from one place to anotherfrom one place to another with text flowing in 
        absence.absence.

        is the ability to have hierarchicalis the ability to have 
        itemized and enumerated lists.  In effect, we want a mechanism that allows us 
        create structures likecreate structures like outlines where the 
        software does thesoftware does the numbering and layout for us.  These are 
        familiar from the <ol> and <ul> tags in HTML.
